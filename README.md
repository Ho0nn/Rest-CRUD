# ðŸ“Œ What is REST?
**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It enables different systems to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. REST focuses on stateless interactions, where each request from a client contains all the information needed to process it, allowing the server to remain stateless and scalable.

## Project Overview ðŸŽ¯
This project creates RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, enabling users to manage resources through basic CRUD operations â€”creating, reading, updating, and deletingâ€” over HTTP. It demonstrates how web services function and facilitates seamless interaction between clients and server resources.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **CRUD Operations**: I set up the ability to create new resources, read existing ones, update them, and delete them as needed. It was exciting to see it all come together!

- **RESTful Principles**: I made sure to follow RESTful principles by using the right HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for each operation. It made the whole process feel organized.

- **Spring Boot Integration**: I used Spring Boot to simplify the setup, which really sped up the development process. It made configuring everything so much easier.

- **JSON Format**: For data exchange, I went with JSON since it's lightweight and easy to work with. It made transferring data between the client and server smooth.

- **Exception Handling**: I learned to implement custom exception handling, which helped manage errors better and provided clear feedback to clients when something went wrong.
